# Notion graph view

The script helps to create graph view based on information it retrieves from notion database.
It takes the data and converts it to graphml format, so it could be viewed in [yEd](https://www.yworks.com/products/yed) afterwards.

At the moment it is wirtten in the way, so it can only work with my databases, but you can use it as a refference to construct something that fits you.
